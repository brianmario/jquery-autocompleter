== jQuery Autocompleter Plugin

But for now, I can tell you that I modeled this autocompleter to be as *simple* as possible.

From a higher level, and autocompleter is nothing more than a submission of the contents of a
single form field to a url, and then displaying the results.
The rest is up in the air. And that is the core principal of this autocompleter plugin.

More documentation to come soon...
